schema CronJobSpec:
    """ CronJobSpec describes how the job execution will look like and when it will actually run.

    Attributes
    ----------
    concurrencyPolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job. Valid values are: - "Allow" (default): allows CronJobs to run concurrently; - "Forbid": forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous run hasn't finished yet; - "Replace": cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new one
    failedJobsHistoryLimit : int, default is Undefined, optional
         The number of failed finished jobs to retain. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 1.
    schedule : str, default is Undefined, required
         The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron.
    startingDeadlineSeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
         Optional deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses scheduled time for any reason.  Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed ones.
    successfulJobsHistoryLimit : int, default is Undefined, optional
         The number of successful finished jobs to retain. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 3.
    suspend : bool, default is Undefined, optional
         This flag tells the controller to suspend subsequent executions, it does not apply to already started executions.  Defaults to false.
    jobTemplate : JobTemplateSpec, default is Undefined, required
         Specifies the job that will be created when executing a CronJob.
