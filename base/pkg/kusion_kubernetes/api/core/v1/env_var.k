schema EnvVar:
    """ EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str, default is Undefined, required
         Name of the environment variable. Must be a C_IDENTIFIER.
    value : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the previously defined environment variables in the container and any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. Defaults to "".
    valueFrom : EnvVarSource, default is Undefined, optional
         Source for the environment variable's value. Cannot be used if value is not empty.
