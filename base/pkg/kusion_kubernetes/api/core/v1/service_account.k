    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : "v1", default is "v1", required
         APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    automountServiceAccountToken : bool, default is Undefined, optional
         AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether pods running as this service account should have an API token automatically mounted. Can be overridden at the pod level.
    imagePullSecrets : [LocalObjectReference], default is Undefined, optional
         ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any images in pods that reference this ServiceAccount. ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets can be mounted in the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
    kind : "ServiceAccount", default is "ServiceAccount", required
         Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    secrets : [ObjectReference], default is Undefined, optional
         Secrets is the list of secrets allowed to be used by pods running using this ServiceAccount. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret
    metadata : apis.ObjectMeta, default is Undefined, optional
         Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
