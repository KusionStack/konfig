schema GCEPersistentDiskVolumeSource:
    """ Represents a Persistent Disk resource in Google Compute Engine.
 A GCE PD must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same GCE project and zone as the kubelet. A GCE PD can only be mounted as read/write once or read-only many times. GCE PDs support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

    Attributes
    ----------
    fsType : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount. Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system. Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
    partition : int, default is Undefined, optional
         The partition in the volume that you want to mount. If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name. Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as "1". Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
    pdName : str, default is Undefined, required
         Unique name of the PD resource in GCE. Used to identify the disk in GCE. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
    readOnly : bool, default is Undefined, optional
         ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts. Defaults to false. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
