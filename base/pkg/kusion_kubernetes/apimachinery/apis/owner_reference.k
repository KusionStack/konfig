schema OwnerReference:
    """ OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an owning object. An owning object must be in the same namespace as the dependent, or be cluster-scoped, so there is no namespace field.

    apiVersion : str, default is Undefined, required
         API version of the referent.

         If true, this reference points to the managing controller.
    kind : str, default is Undefined, required
