    matchExpressions : [LabelSelectorRequirement], default is Undefined, optional
         matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
    matchLabels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
         matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
